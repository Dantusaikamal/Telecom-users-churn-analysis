# Telecom-users-churn-analysis

Customer churn, when a customer ends their relationship with a business, is one of the most basic factors in determining the revenue of a business. You need to know which of your customers are loyal and which are at risk of churning, and you need to know the factors that affect these decisions from a customer perspective. 

Customer churn is likely costlier in telecoms than in other industries based on customersâ€™ attitudes toward the sector, but companies aware of this fact can use data analytics in an effort to specifically bring down churn rates by identifying and relieving customer pain points, as well as understanding customer behavior on a deeper level.
